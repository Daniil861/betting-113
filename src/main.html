											Football (Football from foot + ball) is a team sport, the goal of which is to kick the
											ball into the opponent's goal with your feet or other parts of the body (except hands)
											more times than the opposing team. Currently the most popular and widespread sport in
											the
											world.
										</p>
										<p>
											FIFA and the International Olympic Committee use "soccer" as the official international
											name for the game.
										</p>
										<p>
											The game's full English name, association football, was chosen following the creation
											of
											the English Football Association in 1863 to distinguish the game from other forms of
											football that existed at the time, such as rugby football. football", "football
											according
											to the rules of Rugby School"), where hand play was allowed. Over time, the long names
											of
											game variants began to be shortened in everyday speech and print. At first, the
											abbreviation “assoc.” was common in England, then in the 1880s the term “soccer” was
											formed from it by adding the suffix “-er” to the abbreviation “-soc-” in the Oxford
											manner[en] ( By analogy, rugby football was abbreviated as “rugger” [4]. The term
											"soccer"
											has been used in periodicals since at least 1892.[5] According to the Oxford English
											Dictionary, the earliest use of the word "soccer" in written language is recorded in
											1889
											in a letter by English poet Ernest Dawson (although he spells it socca, presumably
											because
											he did not yet have a standard written form).[6] .
										</p>
										<p>
											Nowadays, the name “soccer” is common in a number of English-speaking countries, where
											other types of football historically continue to be popular. For example, in Australia
											and
											New Zealand, football is historically referred to as Australian rules football or rugby
											league. In Ireland, the term "football" refers to Gaelic football, which is why
											"soccer"
											is used in the press.[7][8] In South Africa, the game is mostly known as "soccer", as
											reflected in the name of the South African championship, the Premier Soccer League, and
											the Soccer City stadium, which hosted the 2010 World Cup final. In the USA and Canada,
											the
											term “soccer” is used, as American football and Canadian football are called football.
											In
											England, the name "soccer" is outdated and new generations of fans now consider it
											disparaging.
										</p>
										<p>
											In other languages the name of the game is:
										</p>

										<p>
											or by borrowing the English word football, as in Russian - “football”, in Portuguese -
											futebol;
										</p>
										<p>
											or a tracing paper of the word football, as for example in German - Fußball, Greek -
											ποδόσφαιρο, Finnish - jalkapallo, Hebrew - כדורגל, Karelian - jalgamiäččy and Adyghe -
											l'epeyu;

											[6] The expansion and cultural influence of the
											British Empire allowed these
											rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly
											controlled
											Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already
											developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local
											traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, The
											Football
											League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football
											associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to
											become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]
